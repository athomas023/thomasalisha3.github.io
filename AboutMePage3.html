						<h1> Family and Origins </h1>

						<section>
							<p>I originated in Springfield, Missouri 28 years ago. I have 5 siblings. All are older than I am. My closest sibling is 23 years older than me and my oldest sibling is 35 years older than me. 
I have many neices and nephews. Some of them are older than me and some are my age. I also have many great neices and nephews. I have 3 cats which are basically 
my family.</p>

	<h1> Work and Hobbies </h1>

<p>I am currently employed at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician and have been there five years. My main duties are data entry, filling prescriptions and customer service.
When I am not at work I enjoy being outdoors. I like to go hiking, camping, kayaking etc... I also play "fiddle" in a band. I like comedies. Some of my favorites comedy shows 
are Portlandia, Flight of the Concords, Saturday Night Live (sometimes). My favorite comedian is probably Conan Obrien. I also enjoy "nerding out" on the internet for hours and
 watching documentaries about anything and everything.</p>

	<h1>My Goals</h1>

<p>My main goal in life right now is to find a job that has nothing to do with customer service. I am an introvert. I enjoy "nerding out" as I mentioned before and I enjoy problem solving.
I decided to come back to school for Computer Science because after several years of not knowing what to do and working in retail, it seemed like the best option. I am not 
entirely sure what my future career will be. Also, I would like to continue playing violin as much as possible.</p>
